                    to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the
                    website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site
                    performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these
                    technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their
                    functioning.

                    among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention,
                    and for other site operations.

                <p> If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash
                    player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings
                    Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and
                    following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete
                    existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs
                    from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how
                    to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the
                    time).

                <p> Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may
                    reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash
                    applications used in connection with our services or online content.
