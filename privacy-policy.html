              <p>
                Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person
                about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
                provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For
                instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
                that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may
                contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to
                us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to
                make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for
                the purposes of verification.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request
                that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
                fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish
                verifying you.
