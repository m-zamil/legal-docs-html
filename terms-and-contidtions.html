                country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do <br />
                so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the

                To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal
                Terms (each a <strong>'Dispute'</strong> and collectively, <strong>'Disputes'</strong>) brought by
                either you or us (individually, a <strong>'Party'</strong> and collectively, the
                <strong>'Parties'</strong>;), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those
                Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least sixty (60) days before initiating
                arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
              </p>
              <p>
                These Terms will be governed by the laws of the Czech Republic, excluding California’s conflicts of law

              </p>
              <h2>Restrictions</h2>
              <p>
                The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.
                To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b)
                there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilise
                class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
                purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
              </p>
              <h2>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h2>
              <p>
                The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning

                arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorised use; and (c) any claim
                for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party
                will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
                unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts
                listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that

                Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise
